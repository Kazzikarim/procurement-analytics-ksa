Title: Procurement & Cost Control Analytics – KSA Oil & Gas (Simulated ERP Data)

I am building a Power BI dashboard that shows procurement delays, supplier performance, and cost leakage using ERP-style tables.

Audience: Procurement Manager / Cost Control Managers

Business problem:
Procurement leadership lacks consolidated visibility into purchasing cycle delays, supplier reliability, and cost leakage across departments, causing budget overruns and operational delays.

KPIs included:
PR to PO cycle time
On-time delivery %
Price variance % vs contract
Spend by category & department
Supplier concentration risk

Tools: Power BI, Excel, SQL (optional)

Files:
/data: CSV tables
/powerbi: PBIX file
/screenshots: dashboard images
/sql: queries for KPI calculations
